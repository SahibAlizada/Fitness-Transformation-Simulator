# Fitness Transformation Simulator

This project estimates how many months it takes to reach 15% body fat based on training frequency and calorie expenditure.

Using an energy-based fat loss model (1 kg fat ≈ 7700 kcal), the analysis calculates:

- Monthly fat loss (kg)
- Estimated months to target body fat
- Time saved compared to training 2 days per week
- Projected body fat percentage over time

The Power BI dashboard functions as an interactive simulator, allowing users to adjust starting fat percentage and workout frequency to estimate their transformation timeline.

## Key Insight

Increasing training frequency from 2 to 4 days per week can reduce transformation time by more than 50% for individuals above 20% body fat.

## Tools Used

- Python (Data Cleaning & Modeling)
- Power BI (Interactive Simulation Dashboard)
